think of a name of a static blog generator

## 🤖 Gemini

Choosing a name for a static site generator (SSG) usually involves balancing two things: the **tech stack** it uses and the **vibe** of being fast, lightweight, and unmoving.

Here are a few ideas categorized by the "energy" they project:

### The "Fast & Light" Crowd

These names emphasize the speed of static files and the lack of a heavy backend.

- **BoltPress:** Simple, punchy, and implies speed.
- **SwiftScript:** Great if the generator is focused on a streamlined workflow.
- **Vapor:** Sounds ethereal and lightweight, as if the site barely exists on the server.
- **AeroStatic:** Suggests something aerodynamic and modern.

### The "Nature & Structure" Crowd

Many popular SSGs (like Hugo or Jekyll) use classic, sturdy names.

- **Cedar:** Sounds reliable, organic, and long-lasting.
- **Monolith:** A bit ironic for a small blog, but suggests something solid and unbreakable.
- **Strata:** Layers of content built up over time.
- **Quarry:** Where you "get the stones" to build your site.

### The "Tech & Dev" Crowd

These are a bit more "on the nose" for developers who like clean syntax.

- **Markdownic:** Perfect if the primary focus is writing in Markdown.
- **HydraSSG:** If the generator can output to multiple platforms at once.
- **NullStack:** A play on "Full Stack," implying there is no server-side stack to worry about.
- **GitGo:** Short, catchy, and implies a Git-based workflow.

### My Personal Favorite:

**"Inkling"**

> It feels creative and literary, but "ink" also implies that once the site is generated, it’s "set in stone" (or paper), which is exactly what a static site is.

## 👤 You

how about a name that's two words that rhyme, the first word is static

## 🤖 Gemini

Going for a rhyming pair is a classic branding move—it makes the name "sticky" and easy to remember. Since "static" has a very specific rhythmic ending, we have to play with the **\-atic** suffix.

Here are some two-word rhyming options for your blog generator:

### The Best Fits

- **Static Attic:** Probably the most "charming" option. It implies a place where you store all your thoughts, stories, and archives.
- **Static Dramatic:** Great if the generator focuses on high-visual impact, bold typography, or portfolio-style layouts.
- **Static Prismatic:** Suggests a generator that takes simple text and turns it into a colorful, multi-faceted site.
- **Static Aquatic:** Perfect if the UI is fluid, blue-toned, or just very "streamlined."

### The "A Bit Out There" Options

- **Static Schematic:** Very "dev-centric." It implies that the blog follows a very precise, engineered blueprint.
- **Static Fanatic:** For the power user who is obsessed with performance scores and lighthouse builds.
- **Static Emphatic:** Suggests a blog that makes a bold statement.
- **Static Lunatic:** A bit edgy and wild—maybe for a generator that uses experimental tech or unconventional builds.

**My Recommendation:** **Static Attic** wins on personality. It’s memorable, easy to say, and fits the "static" nature of the files (they sit there safely, just like things in an attic).

Would you like me to try generating some **logo ideas** or a **sample landing page headline** for "Static Attic"?
