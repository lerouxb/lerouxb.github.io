can you give me the html 5 code for a very minimal page?

Building a minimal HTML5 page is like setting the foundation for a house—you want just enough structure to keep it standing without any unnecessary clutter.

Here is the "skeleton" code that includes all the essential elements required for a valid HTML5 document.

HTML

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Minimal Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a minimal HTML5 starter template.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### What’s happening here?

-   **`<!DOCTYPE html>`**: This tells the browser, "Hey, I'm using the latest version of HTML (HTML5)."
    
-   **`<html lang="en">`**: Defines the language of the document, which helps screen readers and search engines.
    
-   **`<meta charset="UTF-8">`**: Ensures that special characters (like emojis or non-English letters) display correctly.
    
-   **`<meta name="viewport" ...>`**: The secret sauce for mobile responsiveness. It makes sure the page fits properly on phone screens.
    
-   **`<title>`**: This is what appears on the browser tab, not the page itself.
    
-   **`<body>`**: This is where all your visible content lives.
    

Would you like me to add a small block of CSS to this code to make it look a bit more modern?
